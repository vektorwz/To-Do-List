# To-Do-List
/***A To-Do list made C++.***/ </br>
-I made this program to showcase the use of dinamic structures. You're able to write tasks with a title, a description, and a state (in progress/done). Each task has an id which you can use to modify or delete a certain task later. Future features include searching for a task and exporting the list to a binary/text file.</br>
/***How to run***/</br>
-In the meantime you can run this in several ways: the easiest one is using an online compiler like onlinegdb, you paste the code and then run it. You can also paste the code in your preferred IDE and build the application. In the future I'll work in a simplest way to execute it.</br>
DISCLAIMER: The code is written in Spanish which is my preferred language for programming, maybe in the future i'll add an English version, but the concept stays the same.
